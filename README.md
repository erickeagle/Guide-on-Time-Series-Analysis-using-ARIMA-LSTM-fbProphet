A small guide on Time Series.

What is TS Analysis?

Time Series: 
Set of observations taken at a specified time usually at equal intervals. 
It is used to predict future values based on previous observed values.

Considering a graph, when x is time & if the dependent variable depends on time parameter then itâ€™s time series analysis.


Components of TS Analysis:

Trend
Seasonality
Irregularity
Cyclic

When not to use TS Analysis?

1. If the values are constant
2. If the values are in form of a function
